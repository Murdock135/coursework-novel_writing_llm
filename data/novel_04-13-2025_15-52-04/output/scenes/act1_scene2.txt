## ACT & SCENE IDENTIFICATION
Act: 1
Scene: 2
Location: A crowded auditorium at the Technical University of Berlin, where Professor Ehrenfest is lecturing on mechanical automata.

## SCENE DESCRIPTION
The air was alive with the murmur of anticipation as Nikolai, seated near the back, watched Professor Ehrenfest take the stage. The renowned expert's reputation preceded him, and the auditorium was filled with students and scholars eager to hear his insights on mechanical automata. Nikolai, still pondering his encounter with Sabine, found himself drawn to the lecture's promise of exploring the intricacies of artificial creations.

As Professor Ehrenfest began to speak, his words painted vivid pictures of clockwork mechanisms and ingenious devices that mimicked life. Nikolai's interest was piqued, his mind racing with the potential applications and implications of such technology. The professor's discussion of automata as both marvels of engineering and reflections of human ingenuity resonated deeply with Nikolai, echoing the themes of duality he had been exploring in his own work.

## KEY EVENTS
- Nikolai attends Professor Ehrenfest's lecture on mechanical automata, sparking his interest in creating a truly intelligent machine.
- Inspired by the lecture, Nikolai begins to formulate a theoretical framework for an advanced automaton, contemplating the integration of complexity and adaptability.
- Nikolai's thoughts drift to Sabine, and he sees parallels between her multifaceted nature and the potential for creating machines that embody similar dualities.
