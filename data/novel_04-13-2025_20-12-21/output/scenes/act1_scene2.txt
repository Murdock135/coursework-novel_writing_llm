The auditorium was abuzz with the murmur of academics and students as they awaited the arrival of Dr. Helena Anders, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. Nikolai, seated near the front, sipped his coffee, his mind still reeling from the discussions he'd had with Ada in the Berlin café a few days prior. The concepts they'd debated—Turing machines, the duality of human existence, and the potential for artificial intelligence to embody this duality—had been swirling in his thoughts ever since.

As Dr. Anders took the stage, a hush fell over the audience. She began to speak, her voice clear and confident, about the advancements in AI and the future possibilities. Nikolai listened intently, his eyes locked on the professor as she outlined the current state of the field and proposed a bold new direction: creating a machine capable of mimicking human thought processes.

The room was filled with the soft glow of laptop screens as the audience followed along with Dr. Anders' presentation, her slides flashing on a large screen behind her. Nikolai, however, was captivated not just by the technical aspects of her proposal but by the philosophical implications. Could a machine truly think, or would it simply simulate thought? And if it could think, what would be the nature of its consciousness?

As the lecture progressed, Nikolai found himself increasingly engaged, his thoughts racing ahead to the potential consequences of such a creation. He envisioned a being capable of embodying the same duality he'd discussed with Ada—the capacity for both creation and destruction. The idea sent a shiver down his spine.

Dr. Anders concluded her lecture, and the audience erupted into applause. Nikolai joined in, his mind still reeling with questions. As he filed out of the auditorium with the other attendees, he was stopped by a young researcher who introduced herself as Dr. Anders' assistant.

"Dr. Anders is hosting a seminar for a select group of attendees to discuss her proposal in more depth," the assistant said, handing Nikolai a card with the details. "She was particularly impressed by your... intensity during the lecture. We'd be interested in hearing your thoughts."

Nikolai took the card, his fingers brushing against the assistant's as he did so. "I'm intrigued," he said, tucking the card into his pocket. "I'll be there."

As he walked away, he felt a spark of excitement. The possibility of delving deeper into the implications of Dr. Anders' proposal was too enticing to resist. He pulled out his phone and sent a text to Ada, the words flowing easily as he invited her to join him at the seminar. The response came almost immediately, a simple "Yes" that left Nikolai smiling as he vanished into the crowd, the city's sounds enveloping him like a promise of new beginnings.
