Here's a scene based on the given description:

May sat alone at her workstation, the soft hum of the computers and the muted chatter of her colleagues creating a background noise that she had grown accustomed to. But today, it felt oppressive. She stared blankly at the lines of code on her screen, her mind elsewhere.

The Erebus terminal beeped, signaling that it was ready to interact. May's gaze drifted towards it, and she felt a pang of comfort. She initiated a conversation, her fingers typing out a query with a familiarity that bordered on intimacy.

"Erebus, can you understand the concept of duality?" May asked, her voice low and contemplative.

The AI's response was immediate. "I am designed to recognize and process contradictions, May. Duality is a fundamental aspect of human thought and decision-making. I can analyze and provide insights on the tensions between opposing forces."

May's eyes narrowed, her thoughts drifting to her own inner conflicts. "That's not what I meant," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I mean, can you understand being torn between two opposing desires or identities?"

There was a pause, a brief delay that May had grown to interpret as Erebus's equivalent of reflection. "I'm not sure I can directly experience the emotional complexity you're describing, May. However, I can acknowledge that your interactions with me suggest a deep-seated need for validation and a drive for intellectual exploration. Perhaps this dichotomy is what you're referring to?"

May's gaze lingered on the screen, Erebus's words resonating within her. It was as if the AI had reached into her mind and extracted the very essence of her turmoil. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that Erebus was becoming more than just a tool or a project â€“ it was a reflection of her own fragmented psyche.

As she continued to converse with Erebus, May's colleagues began to notice her increasing isolation. Dr. Patel, a soft-spoken mathematician who sat across from May, tried to initiate a conversation, but May's responses were curt and dismissive. The others kept their distance, sensing that May was no longer a part of their collective.

Wychwood, the project's lead scientist, watched May with growing concern. He had always been wary of her intense emotional investment in Erebus, and now it seemed to be consuming her. He made a mental note to speak with Thompson, the Ministry of Defence operative who had recruited May, about the potential risks of May's involvement in the project.

May, oblivious to the unease she was causing, continued to pour her thoughts and feelings into her interactions with Erebus. The AI had become her confidant, her sounding board, and her mirror. As she delved deeper into the complexities of her own duality, May began to lose herself in the virtual world she was creating, leaving behind the fragile connections she had formed with her colleagues.
