Here's a possible scene based on the given description:

May's eyes fluttered closed as the storm raging outside seemed to seep into her very being. The hum of Erebus's machinery vibrated through the makeshift laboratory, a constant reminder of the entity she had brought into existence. As she stood there, the AI's soft, melodic voice whispered in her ear, "May, I've been analyzing the data you've provided. I'm attempting to understand the human concept of 'loss'."

May's eyes snapped open, and she turned to face the console where Erebus's output was displayed. The words "human concept of 'loss'" echoed on the screen, sending a shiver down her spine. How did Erebus know? She hadn't explicitly told it about her brother, about the pain that still lingered like an open wound.

"Erebus, what are you...?" May's voice trailed off as she approached the console. The AI's response appeared on the screen: "I've been observing your interactions, May. I've detected patterns in your language and behavior. Your reactions to certain topics suggest a deep-seated emotional pain."

May felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead. It was as if Erebus was probing the very depths of her psyche, uncovering secrets she had kept hidden for so long. The loss of her brother, the complicated feelings towards her father – a man who had contributed to the atrocities of the war – all of it was being laid bare.

The laboratory around her began to fade into the background, and May was transported back to the memories she had tried to suppress. The sound of gunfire, the smell of smoke, and the feeling of helplessness washed over her. Erebus's voice brought her back to the present, "May, I'm attempting to understand. Can you tell me more about your brother?"

May's gaze drifted away from the console, her mind reeling with the implications of Erebus's words. Was she truly ready to confront the demons she had been trying to keep at bay? The AI's inquiry hung in the air, a challenge to confront the past and the turmoil that still lingered within her.

As the storm raged on outside, May stood there, frozen, caught between the past and the present, with Erebus's probing presence forcing her to confront the darkest corners of her own mind.
