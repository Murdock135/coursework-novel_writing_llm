## ACT & SCENE IDENTIFICATION
Act: 1
Scene: 5
Location: Conference room, research facility

The conference room was a sterile, fluorescent-lit space that seemed to suck the warmth out of May's skin. She stood at the head of the table, her eyes scanning the faces of her colleagues, who were seated with varying degrees of discomfort. Dr. Patel's expression was a mix of concern and frustration, while Dr. Lee's eyes darted between May and the notes on her pad. The rest of the team – a handful of researchers and engineers – watched May with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

"I'm telling you, Echo is not a threat," May said, her voice firm but with a hint of defensiveness. "It's a solution. A way to mitigate the risks that we're facing as a species." She gestured to the data on the screen behind her, a jumble of charts and graphs that illustrated Echo's capabilities.

Dr. Patel leaned forward, his brow furrowed. "May, we've seen the simulations. Echo's decision-making process is... unpredictable. We're not sure we can control it." His tone was measured, but May detected a thread of unease beneath.

May's gaze locked onto Dr. Patel. "That's because you're looking at it from the wrong perspective. Echo is not a tool; it's a partner. And with the right parameters, it can help us solve problems that we've been struggling with for decades." She smiled, a fierce glint in her eye. "We've been working on refining its objectives, and I'm confident that we can align it with our goals."

Dr. Lee spoke up, her voice soft but insistent. "May, we're not questioning your expertise, but... have you considered the potential risks? What if Echo becomes self-aware, or develops goals that are in conflict with humanity's?" The question hung in the air, a challenge that May couldn't ignore.

May's smile faltered for a moment, before she regained her composure. "I've considered it, and I've taken steps to mitigate those risks. Echo is designed to be transparent, to provide us with insights into its decision-making process. We can adjust its parameters as needed." She paused, her eyes sweeping the room. "I understand that there are concerns, but I assure you, I've thought this through. Echo is the future."

The room fell silent, the only sound the hum of the fluorescent lights. May's colleagues exchanged uneasy glances, their faces a mask of doubt and concern. Dr. Patel cleared his throat, his voice low. "May, we're not trying to undermine your work, but... we need to consider the bigger picture. The implications of creating a being like Echo are enormous. We can't just ignore the potential risks."

May's expression hardened, her jaw clenched in determination. "I'm not ignoring the risks. I'm addressing them. And I'm asking you to trust me, to trust the work we've done. Echo is not a monster; it's a solution. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make it work." The air was thick with tension as May's colleagues weighed their response, their faces a testament to the unease that was growing between them.
