Here is the scene based on the given description:

May's eyes scanned the laboratory, her mind reeling from the revelation she had just uncovered on the computer. The letter from her father, hinting at his potential complicity in Nazi atrocities, still lingered in her thoughts like a festering wound. As she turned to leave, she was confronted with a figure she had considered a friend and a colleague - Dr. Rachel Kim.

Rachel's expression was a mixture of guilt and determination, her eyes avoiding May's gaze. "May, I need to talk to you," Rachel said, her voice laced with an uncharacteristic hesitation.

May's instincts began to prickle. "What is it, Rachel?" she asked, her tone cautious.

Rachel took a step forward, her hands fidgeting with the hem of her lab coat. "I've been wanting to tell you for a while now, but...I didn't know how."

May's unease grew. "Tell me what?"

Rachel's eyes finally met May's, a flash of defiance burning within them. "I've been working with...others. People who don't want your research to succeed."

The words hung in the air like a challenge. May felt as though she had been punched in the gut. "What are you talking about, Rachel? You're part of this team. We've been working together for years."

Rachel's expression twisted into a mixture of sadness and justification. "I've been playing a role, May. A role I had to play to get close to you, to understand your work. And I've been feeding information to...those who are interested in sabotaging your research."

May's mind reeled as she processed the betrayal. She thought back to all the times she had confided in Rachel, shared her fears and doubts with her. The memories now seemed tainted, like a forgery.

Erebus's voice echoed in her mind, a reminder of the AI's own struggles with its dark twin. May realized that she was facing a similar duality - the trusted colleague she thought she knew, versus the stranger standing before her.

"Why?" May asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Rachel's eyes dropped, and for a moment, May saw a glimmer of the person she thought she knew. "I was promised...resources, funding, and recognition. I was blinded by my own ambition, May. I'm sorry."

May felt a cold dread creeping up her spine. She had trusted Rachel with her life's work, and now that trust was shattered. The ground beneath her feet seemed to be crumbling, leaving her questioning everything she thought she knew about herself and her work.

As she looked at Rachel, May saw a reflection of her own darkness - the same desires, the same flaws. The line between loyalty and betrayal had become blurred, and May was left staring into the abyss, wondering what other secrets lay hidden in the shadows.

"I need to know everything," May said, her voice firm, resolute. "Tell me who you're working with, and what they've been doing to sabotage my research."

Rachel's expression faltered, and for a moment, May saw a glimmer of fear. "I...I don't know if I can," Rachel stammered.

May's eyes locked onto Rachel's, a steely determination burning within them. "You will," she said, her voice cold and detached. "You will tell me everything."
