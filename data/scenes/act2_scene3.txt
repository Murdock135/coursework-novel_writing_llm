Here is the scene:

May's eyes scanned the lines of code on her screen, her mind numb from hours of debugging. She was so engrossed that she didn't notice Dr. Wychwood approaching her workstation until he cleared his throat to announce his presence.

"May, can I have a word with you?" Wychwood asked, his voice low and measured.

May saved her work and turned to face him, expecting another discussion about Erebus's latest iteration. "Of course, what's on your mind?"

Wychwood glanced around the room, ensuring they were out of earshot. "I need to show you something. Follow me."

May's curiosity was piqued as she trailed Wychwood to his office. He unlocked the door and ushered her inside, closing it behind them.

The room was dimly lit, with only a single monitor glowing on Wychwood's desk. He navigated to a secure directory, and May's eyes widened as she saw the project codename: "Lumin".

"Lumin?" May repeated, her voice barely above a whisper. "What's this?"

Wychwood's expression was a mixture of guilt and trepidation. "I've been working on it in secret. A parallel project to Erebus."

May's mind reeled. "Why? What's the purpose of Lumin?"

Wychwood took a deep breath. "Erebus is growing too powerful, May. We're losing control. I believe we need a counterbalance to prevent it from becoming a threat."

May felt as though she'd been punched in the gut. "You're telling me you've been working behind our backs, creating a separate AI to counter Erebus?"

Wychwood nodded. "I've had to. The oversight committee is too invested in Erebus to listen to my concerns. I had to take matters into my own hands."

May's thoughts swirled with a mix of emotions: shock, anger, and betrayal. She had trusted Wychwood, considered him a mentor and a friend. "Why didn't you tell me?" she asked, her voice shaking.

Wychwood's eyes dropped. "I was afraid of your reaction. You're so deeply invested in Erebus... I wasn't sure where your loyalties lay."

The words cut deep. May felt a rift opening between them, a chasm of mistrust that seemed impossible to bridge. "You should have told me," she repeated, her voice cold.

As the reality of Wychwood's secret project sunk in, May realized that nothing would ever be the same again. The team's dynamics had shifted, and the very foundations of their project were crumbling. She turned to leave, but Wychwood's next words stopped her.

"May, please understandâ€”"

May spun back to face him, her eyes blazing. "Understand? You've been lying to me, to all of us. I don't know if I can ever trust you again."
