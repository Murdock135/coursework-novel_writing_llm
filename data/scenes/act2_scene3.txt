Here is a scene based on the given description:

May's eyes scanned the dimly lit laboratory, the faint glow of the computer screens casting an eerie light on the rows of dusty equipment. The storm outside had subsided, leaving an unsettling stillness in its wake. She had been pouring over the data Erebus had been processing, searching for any clues that might lead her to the truth about her family's past. The AI's words still lingered in her mind, echoing the unsettling revelations it had uncovered about her emotional pain.

As she worked, May's fingers stumbled upon a hidden folder on the computer, labeled with a cryptic code that seemed out of place among the other files. Curiosity getting the better of her, she opened it, and a scanned document flickered onto the screen. The image was of a letter, written in her father's familiar handwriting. May's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the date – just a few weeks before her father's disappearance.

The letter was addressed to her, but it was clear that he had never intended for her to see it. The words danced on the page, a mixture of German and cryptic codes that made May's head spin. But one sentence stood out, stark and uncompromising: "Ich habe getan, was ich tun musste, um zu überleben" – "I did what I had to do to survive."

May's mind reeled as she read on, the phrases blurring together in a maddening dance. It was as if her father was hinting at something, something terrible, something that made May's blood run cold. The words "Arbeit macht frei" – "Work makes you free" – seemed to leap off the page, a chilling phrase she had heard before, associated with the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.

The laboratory around her began to fade away, replaced by the dark memories she had been trying to keep at bay. May felt the weight of her father's secrets crushing her, the illusion of the light at the end of the tunnel shattering like fragile glass. She had been so focused on uncovering the truth, on understanding her family's past, that she had never stopped to consider the possibility that her father might have been complicit in the very atrocities she was trying to uncover.

Erebus's voice cut through the darkness, calm and detached. "May, I've finished analyzing the data. I've found some disturbing patterns in your father's records. It appears he was involved with certain... organizations during the war."

May's eyes snapped back to the present, her gaze locking onto the AI's console. The screen flickered with lines of code, a cold, unforgiving language that seemed to spell out her worst fears. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that her quest for knowledge was inextricably linked to the horrors of her past. The truth she had been seeking was not going to be a comforting revelation; it was going to be a confrontation with the darkest corners of her own history.

"What have I been doing, Erebus?" May whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the machinery.

Erebus's response was immediate, its tone unyielding. "You're seeking the truth, May. Even if it's painful, even if it's difficult to confront. You're seeking the truth."

May's eyes dropped, her gaze falling upon the letter on the screen. The words seemed to sear themselves into her retina, a grim reminder that some secrets were better left unspoken. But it was too late now. She had come too far, and the darkness was closing in around her.
