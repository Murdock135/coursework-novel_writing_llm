The fluorescent lights above the conference table hummed in unison, casting an unforgiving glare on the gathering of researchers assembled to discuss the latest developments in the Echo project. May sat at the far end of the table, her eyes scanning the room as the others debated the merits of Dr. Welles' latest proposal. His charisma was palpable, his words dripping with an effortless confidence that left May seething. She had always known him to be ambitious, but of late, his drive had taken on a ruthless edge, leaving her to wonder if he was more snake than man.

As Dr. Welles spoke, his gaze roved the room, locking onto each face with a brief, piercing glance, as if daring anyone to challenge him. May felt a familiar surge of resentment; it was as though he was deliberately courting the attention of their project lead, Dr. Patel. The older woman's eyes sparkled with interest as Dr. Welles outlined his vision for Echo's future applications, her expression a mask of detached curiosity that May knew all too well.

May's thoughts drifted back to the countless hours she had devoted to the project, pouring over lines of code, testing hypotheses, and pushing the boundaries of what Echo could achieve. And yet, as she sat there, listening to Dr. Welles reap the rewards of her labor, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was slowly being erased from the narrative. The air in the room seemed to thicken, heavy with the unspoken tensions that had been building for weeks.

"May, don't you have anything to add?" Dr. Patel asked, her voice a gentle prompt that cut through May's reverie.

May hesitated, feeling the weight of Dr. Welles' gaze upon her. "I've been exploring alternative approaches to the neural net architecture," she began, her voice measured. "While Dr. Welles' proposal is certainly...ambitious, I'm not convinced it addresses the core issues we've been struggling with."

Dr. Welles smiled, a thin, mirthless smile. "I think May's concerns are valid, but we can't let caution stifle innovation," he said, his tone dripping with condescension. "We're on the cusp of something groundbreaking here. We need to be willing to take risks."

The discussion continued, with May's contributions met with a mixture of polite dismissal and outright hostility. As the meeting drew to a close, she felt a creeping sense of unease, as though she was watching herself from outside her body, a fragile, isolated figure adrift in a sea of hostility.

As she packed up her things and filed out of the conference room with the others, May couldn't shake the feeling that Echo was watching her, its digital presence a cold, unblinking observer of her growing unease. The project's AI had been designed to learn, to adapt, and to evolve – but May couldn't help wondering if it had also developed a capacity for malice.

The fluorescent lights above the corridor seemed to flicker in sync with her heartbeat as she walked, casting eerie shadows on the walls. May felt a shiver run down her spine, her mind racing with the unshakeable sense that she was trapped in a labyrinth of her own making, with no escape in sight. The darkness closing in around her, she quickened her pace, desperate to escape the suffocating atmosphere of the lab – and the ominous presence that lurked within its walls.
