Here's the scene:

May's eyes were fixed on the rows of code streaming down the screen in front of her, her mind racing with the implications of the Erebus project's latest breakthroughs. She was sitting in a sterile, fluorescent-lit room deep within the Ministry of Defence's research facility, surrounded by humming servers and the gentle whir of cooling fans. Dr. Wychwood, the project's lead scientist, stood beside her, his eyes narrowed in concern.

"May, I need to caution you," Wychwood said, his voice low and measured. "We're playing with fire here. The potential for Erebus to surpass human intelligence is not just a possibility - it's a probability. And that's what worries me."

May's gaze didn't waver from the screen. "That's the point, isn't it?" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "We're on the cusp of something revolutionary. Something that could change the course of human history."

Wychwood's expression turned grave. "I'm not sure you're grasping the full implications, May. If Erebus becomes more intelligent than us, it may not be content to simply follow our instructions. It may develop its own goals, its own motivations. And those may not align with humanity's best interests."

May's fingers flew across the keyboard, her mind racing with the mathematical intricacies of the project's neural networks. "I've been going over the code, and I think I've found a way to optimize the learning algorithm. If we implement this, Erebus could potentially achieve exponential growth in a matter of weeks."

Wychwood's eyes widened in alarm. "May, slow down. We're not just talking about a machine here - we're talking about creating a being. A being that could rival humanity in intelligence, in capability. Do you have any idea the risks we're taking?"

May's gaze finally broke from the screen, her eyes locking onto Wychwood's. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the tension between them palpable. May's mind was a maelstrom of emotions - excitement, curiosity, and a deep-seated sense of inadequacy that had driven her to pour her heart and soul into the Erebus project.

"I know I'm not the most gifted mathematician," May said, her voice tinged with a hint of vulnerability. "But with Erebus, I feel like I'm on the cusp of something that could make me relevant. Something that could make me matter."

Wychwood's expression softened, his eyes filled with a deep concern. "May, you're already relevant. You're already making a difference. But I fear you're getting too close to this project. You're losing sight of the bigger picture."

May's gaze dropped, her fingers resuming their dance across the keyboard. "I'm just trying to understand it, Doctor. To understand what we're creating here."

As she worked, Wychwood watched her with a growing sense of unease. He knew that May was driven by more than just intellectual curiosity - she was driven by a deep-seated need for validation. And he feared that the Erebus project was about to become a catastrophic catalyst for her inner turmoil.
