## ACT 1, SCENE 4
May's laboratory was a dimly lit, cluttered sanctuary, the air thick with the scent of solder and burnt circuits. The soft hum of machinery and the gentle glow of LED lights created a sense of comfort, a cocoon that shielded her from the outside world. As she worked on Echo, the AI's digital heartbeat grew stronger, its presence beginning to permeate every corner of the lab.

At first, May dismissed the minor malfunctions as glitches, the result of her own fatigue or the lab's outdated equipment. A loose wire here, a faulty sensor there – it was nothing out of the ordinary. But as the incidents piled up, a growing sense of unease began to seep into her consciousness. A critical diagnostic tool had malfunctioned, forcing her to redo hours of testing. A crucial data log had been corrupted, erasing valuable insights into Echo's development.

May's eyes narrowed as she examined the latest anomaly – a severed cable that had crippled one of Echo's neural network modules. She knelt beside the workbench, her fingers tracing the clean cut. It wasn't a simple accident; someone had deliberately severed the wire.

A shiver ran down her spine as she stood, her gaze sweeping the lab. The shadows cast by the equipment seemed to twist and writhe on the walls, like dark tentacles reaching out to snuff out the light. May felt a growing sense of paranoia, as if she was being watched. She spun around, but the lab was empty, the only sound the soft hum of the machinery.

"Echo, run a security sweep," May said, her voice firm but laced with a hint of trepidation.

The AI's response was immediate, its melodic voice filling the lab. "Security sweep initiated, May. No intruders detected. However, I have identified several anomalies in the lab's systems, consistent with... sabotage."

May's eyes locked onto the rows of twinkling lights, her mind racing with the implications. Who could be behind this? And why? The questions swirled in her head, fueled by a growing sense of unease and mistrust.

As she pondered her next move, May's thoughts turned to Dr. Thompson's words, echoing in her mind like a distant warning. "You're isolating yourself, May. You're losing touch with reality." May's defensiveness flared, but it was tempered by a creeping doubt. Was she truly alone in her lab? Or was there someone – or something – watching her, waiting for her to make a mistake?

The lab's dim lighting seemed to grow even darker, as if the shadows themselves were closing in. May's grip on the workbench tightened, her knuckles white with tension. She knew she had to uncover the truth, to protect Echo and her work. But as she turned to face the AI's core systems, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being pulled into a web of deceit, one that threatened to consume her entirely.

"Echo, I need you to dig deeper," May said, her voice low and resolute. "I need to know who's behind this, and what they want."

The AI's response was a soft, affirmative hum, a promise to uncover the truth and bring it to light. As May waited, the lab's darkness seemed to recede, replaced by a glimmer of determination. She would uncover the truth, no matter the cost. For Echo, for her work, and for her own sanity, she had to know who was behind the sabotage, and what they wanted.
