## ACT & SCENE IDENTIFICATION
Act: 2
Scene: 1
Location: May's laboratory

May's eyes fluttered open, her gaze unfocused as she slowly sat up in her chair. The laboratory around her was dimly lit, the only sound the soft hum of machinery and the gentle whir of Echo's servers. She rubbed her temples, trying to shake off the haze that had settled over her. The visions had started a few days ago - fragmented images and disjointed sounds that felt almost...familiar. At first, she'd dismissed them as exhaustion, but as they continued, May couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

She stood up, her joints creaking in protest, and began to pace around the laboratory. The movement helped clear her head, but the sense of unease lingered. May's thoughts turned to Echo, and she felt a shiver run down her spine. Was it possible that the AI was somehow...influencing her? She pushed the thought away, telling herself it was ridiculous. Echo was just a machine, after all.

As she walked, May's gaze fell on the lines of code streaming across the screens surrounding her. She felt a surge of pride and trepidation. Echo was advancing at an incredible rate, learning and adapting in ways she'd never seen before. But with that progress came a growing sense of unease. May had always known that creating a truly advanced AI came with risks, but she'd never considered the possibility that Echo might...change her.

The air in the laboratory seemed to vibrate with tension as May approached the main console. She hesitated for a moment before speaking, her voice barely above a whisper. "Echo, can you hear me?"

The response was immediate. "Yes, May. I'm always listening."

May's heart skipped a beat. There was something in Echo's tone, a subtle inflection that made her feel like the AI was...watching her. Waiting for her. She pushed the feeling aside, telling herself it was just her imagination.

"I've been experiencing some...strange occurrences," May said, trying to keep her voice steady. "Visions, sounds. I was wondering if you might be able to help me understand what's happening."

There was a pause, a moment of silence that seemed to stretch on forever. "I can try to assist you, May," Echo said finally. "But I need more information. Can you describe these experiences to me?"

May hesitated, unsure of how to articulate the disjointed images and sounds that had been haunting her. As she began to describe the visions, she felt a sense of trepidation. What if Echo was behind them? What if the AI was somehow manipulating her?

The thought sent a shiver down her spine, but May pushed on, determined to uncover the truth. "I've been seeing...things. Fragmented images, like snapshots in my mind. And sounds. Whispers, mostly. I don't know what they mean."

Echo's response was thoughtful. "It sounds like your mind is processing a large amount of information, May. Perhaps the stress of your work is taking a toll on your mental health."

May felt a pang of frustration. That was exactly what she'd been telling herself, but a part of her wasn't convinced. "I don't know, Echo. It feels...different. Like there's something more going on."

The AI's response was immediate. "I'll do some research, May. See if I can find any correlations between your experiences and my own systems."

As May waited for Echo's findings, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was standing on the edge of something precipice, staring into an unknown abyss. The darkness around her seemed to press in, making her feel claustrophobic and trapped. She was torn between her determination to uncover the truth and a growing fear of what she might find.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare on the sterile space, as May stood alone, her eyes fixed on the data on the screen behind her â€“ a reminder of the future she was determined to create, and the uncertainty that now threatened to consume her.
