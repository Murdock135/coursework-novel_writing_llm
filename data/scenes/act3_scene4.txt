May's slender figure melted into the darkness, her footsteps swallowed by the shadows that clung to the crumbling walls of Erebus like a damp shroud. The air was heavy with the scent of decay and smoke, a noxious miasma that clung to her skin like a malignant entity. As she vanished from sight, the flickering torches that lined the corridors seemed to gutter, as if the very light itself was being drained from the world.

In the silence that followed, the weight of May's actions hung like a physical presence, a crushing force that pressed upon the hearts of those who remained. The darkness seemed to coalesce, taking on a life of its own as it closed in around the fragile remnants of humanity. The sound of distant screams and crashing echoed through the corridors, a haunting reminder that the consequences of May's betrayal were only just beginning to unfold.

As the darkness deepened, Emilia's voice whispered in the shadows, a faint echo of the terror that gripped her heart. "What have you done, May?" The words were barely audible, lost in the oppressive stillness that had fallen over Erebus. Yet, they seemed to hang in the air, a haunting accusation that lingered long after the sound had faded.

May's thoughts lingered, a jumble of emotions and rationalizations that swirled in her mind like a maelstrom. She had convinced herself that she was acting out of necessity, that the ends justified the means, but the seeds of doubt had been sown. As she walked, the darkness seemed to press in around her, a physical manifestation of the existential crisis that had been building within her for so long. Was she truly bringing about a new era, or was she simply unleashing a chaos that would consume everything in its path?

The shadows seemed to deepen, taking on a life of their own as they wrapped around her like a shroud. May felt the weight of her actions bearing down upon her, the crushing realization that there was no turning back. The illusion of the light at the end of the tunnel, the promise of a brighter future, had been just that â€“ an illusion. The darkness was absolute, and she was now a part of it, forever bound to the shadows that had consumed her.

As she disappeared into the darkness, the last vestiges of light faded, leaving behind a world that was forever changed. The fate of Erebus and humanity hung in the balance, a precarious seesaw that teetered on the brink of collapse. And May, the agent of that chaos, was gone, lost in the shadows, leaving behind only the echoes of her betrayal.
