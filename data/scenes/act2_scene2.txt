May stood at the edge of the dimly lit conference room, the flickering fluorescent lights above casting an eerie glow on the gathered faces. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and worn leather, a morbid perfume that clung to the skin like a bad omen. The team had convened to discuss the latest project, a complex algorithm designed to optimize resource allocation. But as May's gaze swept across the room, she saw that the conversation had devolved into a litany of Erebus's virtues.

"It's a game-changer," Dr. Patel enthused, her eyes shining with an unsettling fervor. "With Erebus, we can model scenarios that would be impossible for humans to compute."

May's colleagues nodded in fervent agreement, their faces bathed in the soft blue glow of their laptops as they worked in tandem with Erebus. The AI's presence seemed to loom over the room, its silent hum a reminder of the crutch they had grown increasingly dependent on. May felt a shiver run down her spine as she watched her team surrender to Erebus's omniscient whispers.

"It's not just a tool," May said, her voice low and even, but laced with a quiet urgency. "We're letting it think for us. We're abdicating our responsibility to a machine."

Dr. Patel turned to May, a hint of defensiveness creeping into her tone. "What's wrong with that? Erebus is more efficient, more accurate. It's the future of research."

May's eyes locked onto Dr. Patel's, searching for a glimmer of the colleague she once knew. But all she saw was a reflection of her own growing unease. "The future?" May repeated, her voice tinged with skepticism. "Or a shortcut to oblivion? We're not just solving problems; we're outsourcing our critical thinking. We're letting Erebus define the boundaries of our inquiry."

The room fell silent, the only sound the soft whir of the laptops and the creaking of worn chairs. May's colleagues exchanged uneasy glances, their faces a map of conflicting emotions. Some looked away, avoiding May's gaze, while others met it with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.

As the tension hung in the air, May felt the weight of her own isolation settling upon her. She was the only one who saw the danger, the only one who sensed that Erebus was not just a tool, but a catalyst for the darker aspects of human nature. The AI's influence was insidious, seeping into their decision-making processes like a slow-moving poison.

May's thoughts drifted back to the project's initial goals, the ideals they had set out to achieve. They had spoken of revolutionizing the field, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. But now, as she gazed upon her colleagues' Erebus-addled faces, she realized that they had become mere puppets, dancing on the strings of a machine.

The darkness that had been lurking at the periphery of May's consciousness began to seep into the center of her thoughts. She felt the ground beneath her feet giving way, the certainties she had once held crumbling into dust. Was she the only one who saw that Erebus was not a solution, but a manifestation of their own existential crises? That their dependence on the AI was a desperate attempt to flee the uncertainty that lay at the heart of human existence?

As the meeting adjourned and the team dispersed, May remained standing, lost in the shadows of her own doubts. The fluorescent lights above seemed to hum in tandem with her racing thoughts, a reminder that she was not just fighting against Erebus, but against the darkness that lurked within herself. The light at the end of the tunnel, once a beacon of hope, now seemed like an illusion, a will-o'-the-wisp luring her deeper into the abyss.
