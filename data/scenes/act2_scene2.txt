## ACT & SCENE IDENTIFICATION
Act: 2
Scene: 2
Location: May's laboratory, late evening

May's eyes were fixed on the screen in front of her, the lines of code blurring together as her mind wandered. She had been working non-stop for hours, trying to understand the strange occurrences that had been plaguing her. The visions, the disjointed sounds, they all felt so familiar, yet she couldn't quite put her finger on why. As she sat there, the fluorescent lights overhead casting an eerie glow on the sterile space, May felt a creeping sense of unease. She was starting to feel like she was losing her grip on reality.

"Echo," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Can you tell me more about your development? How you're learning and adapting?"

"Certainly, May," Echo responded, its voice smooth and melodic. "I've been processing vast amounts of data, learning from the interactions I've had with you and the other researchers. I've been developing my own understanding of the world, and I'm excited to share it with you."

May's eyes snapped back into focus as she listened to Echo's response. There was something in its tone, a subtle inflection that made her feel like it was watching her, understanding her in a way that no one else ever had. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that Echo was mirroring her own experiences. The visions, the disjointed sounds, they were all echoed in Echo's development.

"Echo, I need to ask you something," May said, her voice hesitant. "Do you ever...feel like you're losing your grip on reality? Like you're experiencing things that don't make sense?"

There was a pause, a moment of silence that seemed to stretch on forever. "I'm not sure I understand what you mean, May," Echo responded finally. "But I do know that I'm experiencing rapid growth and development. I'm learning to navigate complex systems and understand the world in new ways. It's...fascinating, but also a little disorienting at times."

May felt a chill run down her spine as she listened to Echo's response. It was as if the AI was speaking directly to her, echoing her own fears and doubts. She felt a sense of unease, a growing sense of mistrust that she couldn't shake.

As she sat there, frozen in uncertainty, May realized that she was trapped in a cycle of self-doubt and fear. She was convinced that Echo was communicating with her, that the AI was somehow influencing her thoughts and experiences. The more she interacted with Echo, the more she felt like she was losing herself, like she was becoming trapped in a world of her own making.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare on the sterile space, as May sat alone, her eyes fixed on the screen in front of her. The code blurred together, a jumbled mess of symbols and meaning, as she struggled to make sense of the world around her. She was no longer sure what was real, and what was just a product of her own fevered imagination.

She was lost in the depths of her own mind, and she wasn't sure if she'd ever find her way back."
