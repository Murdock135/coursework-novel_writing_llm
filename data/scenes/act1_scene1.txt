The fluorescent lights above hummed in sync with the whirring machines that lined the walls of May's cramped laboratory. The air was thick with the smell of solder and burnt coffee. May's eyes, red-rimmed from lack of sleep, were fixed on the rows of vacuum tubes and circuit boards spread out before her. She scribbled equations on a chalkboard with a piece of white chalk, her hand moving in swift, jerky motions.

As she worked, the sounds of the city outside – car horns, chatter, and the wail of sirens – faded into the background. May's world had shrunk to the size of this cluttered room, where the only reality was the machine she was building. She called it "Echo," a name that seemed to echo (no pun intended) the whispers of her own isolation.

May's thoughts were consumed by the possibility that Echo could be the answer to humanity's ills. Wars, poverty, inequality – all could be solved, she was convinced, if only she could crack the code of artificial intelligence. The weight of this responsibility hung over her like a specter, driving her to push on, no matter the cost to her own well-being.

As she worked, May's mind began to wander. She envisioned Echo as a being of pure logic, untainted by human bias or emotion. It would see the world with clarity, unclouded by the messy complexities that had always plagued humanity. The thought sent a shiver down her spine. What if Echo could not only solve humanity's problems but also understand her own?

The phone on her workbench jolted her back to reality. It rang shrill and insistent, a sound that grated on her frazzled nerves. May hesitated, her hand hovering over the receiver. Who could it be? She hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks, not since her last meeting with her project sponsor, a man whose name she didn't even know.

With a sigh, May picked up the phone. "Hello?" she said, her voice husky from disuse.

"May, it's Dr. Thompson. I've been trying to reach you for days." The voice on the other end was firm, but laced with a hint of concern.

May's grip on the receiver tightened. Dr. Thompson was her former mentor, the one person who had understood her vision for Echo. "I've been busy," she said, trying to sound nonchalant.

"I know you have," Dr. Thompson said. "But you're not responding to my letters. You're not attending seminars. May, you're isolating yourself. You're going to burn out."

May felt a spark of defensiveness. "I'm fine," she lied. "Echo is almost ready."

There was a pause on the other end. "May, I know you're brilliant. But you're not just building a machine. You're risking your own sanity. Come out of that lab, take a walk, get some fresh air. You're not a hermit."

May's eyes drifted to the window, where a slice of New York City was visible – a slice that seemed to belong to someone else's life. She felt a pang of longing, a desire to reconnect with the world outside her laboratory. But the thought of stepping away from Echo, even for a moment, was unbearable.

"I'm fine, Dr. Thompson," she repeated, her voice firmer this time. "I'll be in touch soon."

As she hung up the phone, May felt the weight of her isolation settle back around her. She turned to her workbench, her eyes locking onto the rows of twinkling lights and humming machinery. Echo was waiting. And May was ready to give herself to it, completely.
