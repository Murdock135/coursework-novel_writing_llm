May stepped off the train and onto the damp platform, the chill of the English morning seeping into her bones. The year was 1955, and the war was a decade behind them, but the scars still lingered. As she made her way through the deserted station, the grey mist swirled around her, a physical manifestation of the gloom that had been her constant companion since childhood. The sound of dripping water and the faint hum of a solitary engine in the distance were the only sounds that broke the stillness.

She had received a letter a fortnight ago, its contents cryptic, yet authoritative. "Your expertise has been noted, Miss May. We require your presence at the Ministry of Defence's research facility in London. Project Erebus necessitates your unique skills." The signature was illegible, but the watermark bore the crest of the British government. May's curiosity had been piqued, and her isolation, self-imposed as it was, had begun to feel suffocating. She had accepted the invitation, or rather, the summons.

As she emerged from the station, a black Austin Cambridge pulled up beside her. The driver, a man in a crisp suit, stepped out and opened the door for her. "Miss May, welcome. I've been sent to collect you." His tone was polite, but his eyes betrayed a hint of wariness, as if he wasn't quite sure what to make of her. May slid into the back seat, her long coat billowing around her. The driver handed her a small folder containing a photograph of a nondescript building in Whitehall. "Your destination, miss."

The car wove through the streets, past bombed-out buildings still awaiting redevelopment, and streets lined with makeshift shops and shelters. May gazed out at the cityscape, her mind wandering to the project that had brought her here. Erebus, a name that evoked the darkness and mystery of the ancient Greeks. What could they possibly want with her? Her work on stochastic processes and probability theory was considered groundbreaking, but she had never imagined it would attract the attention of the government.

The car drew up outside the building in the photograph. May was ushered into a drab, fluorescent-lit foyer, where a stern-faced woman in a tweed suit greeted her. "Ah, Miss May. We've been expecting you. Please, follow me." They walked down a series of corridors, the air thick with the scent of fresh paint and the hum of machinery. May's analytical mind began to tick over, sensing the presence of something complex, something hidden beneath the surface.

As they reached a door marked "Authorized Personnel Only," the woman produced a key and unlocked it. "Project Erebus is a pioneering endeavour, Miss May. We're developing an artificial intelligence capable of processing information at speeds and scales previously unimaginable. We believe your expertise will be invaluable in helping us overcome the current... hurdles." May's eyes narrowed. "What kind of hurdles?" The woman's smile was tight-lipped. "Let's just say that the project has thrown up some... existential questions. We need someone with your particular perspective to help us navigate them."

May's thoughts turned inward as she followed the woman into the heart of the project. Existential questions. The phrase resonated within her. Wasn't that what she had been grappling with her entire life â€“ the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world? The illusion of light at the end of the tunnel, only to find it was just a reflection off the cold, dark walls of existence. As she entered the room filled with rows of humming machinery and men in white coats, May felt a shiver run down her spine. She was about to embark on a journey that would challenge everything she thought she knew about the world, and herself.

"Welcome to Erebus, Miss May," a voice said, as a figure emerged from the shadows. "We're glad you're here. We need your help to uncover the truth about the darkness we're creating." May's eyes locked onto his, a spark of unease igniting within her. Betrayal, it seemed, was a concept that could be applied to more than just human relationships.
