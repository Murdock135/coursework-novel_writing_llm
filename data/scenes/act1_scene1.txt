The fog swirled through the streets of London like a damp, grey blanket, shrouding the city in an impenetrable mist. May huddled in her worn coat, her eyes fixed on the pavement as she walked, her mind lost in the intricate web of mathematical concepts that had consumed her every waking moment for weeks. The sound of her heels clicking on the wet stone was the only accompaniment to her thoughts, a steady beat that underscored her reverie.

As she turned a corner, a black Austin Princess limousine glided to a stop beside her, its engine purring softly. The door opened with a discreet creak, and a suited figure emerged, his eyes scanning the fog-shrouded street before coming to rest on May.

"Dr. May?" he inquired, his voice low and polite.

May's gaze snapped up, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the man's crisp, navy-blue suit and the subtle gleam of a government-issue ID badge at his waist.

"Yes?" she replied warily, her hand tightening around the strap of her worn leather satchel.

"I'm Agent Thompson, from the Ministry of Defence," the man explained, his smile a thin, courteous line. "We've been looking for you, Dr. May. You come highly recommended."

May's expression remained skeptical, her eyes never leaving Thompson's face. "Recommended? By whom?"

Thompson's smile widened, ever so slightly. "Let's just say that your...particular talents have not gone unnoticed, Dr. May. We're interested in discussing a project with you, one that requires a certain...uniqueness of thought."

May's curiosity was piqued, despite her initial wariness. She had always kept her work private, hidden away from the prying eyes of her colleagues and the academic politics that seemed to suffocate the mathematical community. The idea that someone had taken notice of her research, and was willing to seek her out, was both intriguing and unsettling.

"I'm listening," she said, her voice a little softer.

Thompson gestured towards the open door of the limousine. "If you'd be so kind as to join me, Dr. May? We're waiting for you."

May hesitated for a moment, the fog swirling around her like a living entity. She had always been a recluse, content to lose herself in the abstract world of numbers and equations. But something about Thompson's words resonated deep within her â€“ a sense that this project, whatever it might be, was connected to the very fabric of the world she lived in.

With a quiet nod, May stepped into the limousine, the door closing behind her with a soft thud. As the car pulled away from the curb, she caught a glimpse of the fog-shrouded cityscape, the streetlights casting eerie, diffused glows in the mist.

"Where are we headed, Agent Thompson?" she asked, her voice a little firmer now.

Thompson's smile was a hint of satisfaction. "We're bound for a facility in the countryside, Dr. May. A place where we're working on a...pioneering project. Codenamed 'Erebus'."

May's eyes locked onto Thompson's, a spark of curiosity igniting within her. "Erebus?" she repeated, her mind already racing with the implications.

Thompson nodded, his expression serious. "Yes, Dr. May. A project that could change the course of history. And we believe you're the only one who can help us make it happen."

As the limousine disappeared into the fog, May felt the weight of the world shifting around her, like the subtle rearrangement of mathematical constants. She had a feeling that her life was about to become very different indeed.
