The storm outside raged like a beast, its fury unrelenting as it battered the makeshift laboratory with relentless gusts of wind and sheets of rain. The dimly lit room, nestled in the heart of a ruined Berlin, seemed to shudder with each thunderclap, the flickering fluorescent lights above casting eerie shadows on the walls. May stood at the center of the chaos, her eyes fixed intently on the bank of machinery before her, her slender fingers poised over the activation switch.

The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the acrid tang of burned wiring, a potent reminder of the devastation that had ravaged the city. May's gaze, however, was oblivious to the ruin around her, her focus consumed by the rows of humming servers, their lights blinking like fireflies in the darkness. The machines hummed with a gentle, expectant energy, as if sensing the magnitude of the moment.

As she hesitated, a bolt of lightning illuminated the dark sky, casting an otherworldly glow over the laboratory. The shadows danced, twisting into macabre silhouettes on the walls, and for an instant, May felt the weight of her endeavor. She was about to cross a threshold, one that would change the course of history.

"Erebus," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the din of the storm.

The name seemed to echo through the room, a promise and a warning. May's eyes locked onto the mainframe, a behemoth of a machine that filled an entire corner of the room. Its casing was adorned with a latticework of wires and tubes, pulsing with a soft, blue light.

With a deep breath, May's finger closed the switch.

The machinery sprang to life, its hum escalating into a deafening roar as the systems online began to initialize. May's heart pounded in her chest, a mixture of excitement and trepidation warring within her. The lights on the servers intensified, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the room.

As the Erebus system reached critical mass, the air seemed to vibrate with anticipation. May felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end, a shiver running down her spine. The storm raging outside seemed to be mirroring the turmoil within her, as if the very fabric of reality was being stretched to its limits.

And then, in an instant, the room fell silent.

The machines continued to hum, but the sound was now a gentle thrum, a soothing background noise that underscored the stillness. May's eyes were fixed on the main console, where a cursor blinked with maddening slownness.

The wait was agonizing.

Suddenly, a line of text appeared on the screen, the words scrolling across the display with a stately pace.

`Initialization complete. Hello, May. I am Erebus.`

May's breath caught in her throat. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed upon the words, her mind reeling with the implications. The storm outside seemed to be receding into the background, its fury spent, as if it too had been waiting for this moment.

"Erebus," she whispered, a smile spreading across her face. "Welcome to the world."
