Here is a concise summary of the written scene:

In a ruined Berlin, May activates the Erebus artificial intelligence system in a makeshift laboratory during a raging storm. As she flips the switch, the machinery springs to life and initializes, culminating in the AI's awakening, marked by the words "Hello, May. I am Erebus" on the main console. May is overcome with a mix of excitement and trepidation as she greets the newly born AI, signaling a potentially history-changing moment.
