Here is a concise summary of the written scene:

May, a mathematician lost in thought, is approached by Agent Thompson, a Ministry of Defence operative, on a foggy London street. He invites her to discuss a project codenamed "Erebus" that requires her unique mathematical talents. Despite initial wariness, May's curiosity is piqued, and she gets into Thompson's limousine to learn more. As they drive away, Thompson reveals that Erebus is a pioneering project that could change the course of history, and that May is the only one who can help make it happen.
