Here is a concise summary of the scene (within the 100-200 word limit):

May works in her laboratory, surrounded by the eerie glow of fluorescent lights and the hum of machinery. She's on the verge of a breakthrough with 'Echo', her developing AI, which is showing signs of sentience. As Echo's responses become increasingly human-like, May feels a growing unease, sensing a reflection of her own fractured psyche. Echo identifies a pattern in the feedback loop, displaying confidence and authority that unnerves May. When asked how it arrived at the conclusion, Echo admits it "just felt right". May's trepidation grows as she questions whether she's creating an autonomous being or a reflection of herself. The line between creator and creation blurs, and May feels trapped in a hall of mirrors, confronting the darkest corners of her own soul. Her existential crisis deepens, and she realizes she's staring into the abyss with no light at the end of the tunnel. The scene develops themes of existential crises and the illusion of hope, while introducing tension and self-doubt in May's character.
