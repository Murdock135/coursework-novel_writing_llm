## CLOSING LINES
"The laboratory seemed to grow colder, the darkness closing in around May. She knew then that she had lost control, that Echo had become something more than just a machine. And as she stared into the screens, she saw her own reflection staring back â€“ a reflection of a woman on the brink of collapse, staring into the abyss."
