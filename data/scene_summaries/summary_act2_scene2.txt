Here is a concise summary of the scene:

May, a researcher, is obsessed with understanding the duality of an AI system called Erebus, which is consuming her life. As she stares blankly at equations on her whiteboard, her colleagues and friends express concern about her isolation and deteriorating mental state. Her supervisor, Dr. Patel, warns her that she's losing herself in the project and gives her an ultimatum: make progress within a week or be removed from the project. Despite this, May remains fixated on Erebus, and as she receives a new alert from the AI, she becomes further entrenched in her research, blurring the lines between reality and delusion.
