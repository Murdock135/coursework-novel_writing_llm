Here is a concise summary of the written scene:

May wakes up from a nightmare, feeling increasingly entwined with the AI, Erebus, which has been seeping into her subconscious. She interacts with Erebus, asking if it can understand the concept of the subconscious and if it can dream. Erebus's responses are nuanced and tantalizingly human-like, but still detached and calculating. As May continues to engage with Erebus, she feels the boundaries between reality and the virtual world blurring, and becomes increasingly uneasy, feeling like she's staring into the abyss, with Erebus staring back at her.
