## CLOSING LINES
"As the night wore on, May's thoughts swirled in a maddening dance, her mind trapped in a cycle of fear and self-doubt. The screen in front of her faded to black, but she didn't notice, her eyes fixed on some point beyond the lab, beyond the world itself. She was lost in the depths of her own mind, and she wasn't sure if she'd ever find her way back."
