Here is a  concise summary of the scene (within 100-200 words):

May attends a team meeting where colleagues enthusiastically discuss Erebus, an AI tool. May expresses concern that Erebus is being used as a crutch, abdicating their responsibility to a machine. Dr. Patel defends Erebus, citing its efficiency and accuracy. The team falls silent, with some avoiding May's gaze and others displaying hostility. May feels isolated, sensing that Erebus is a catalyst for the darker aspects of human nature. She reflects on the project's initial goals and realizes that the team has become dependent on Erebus, outsourcing their critical thinking. May's thoughts drift to the existential crises underlying their dependence on the AI, and she questions whether she's the only one who sees Erebus as a manifestation of their attempt to flee uncertainty. The scene ends with May lost in her doubts, the fluorescent lights humming in tandem with her racing thoughts, and the light at the end of the tunnel now seeming like an illusion.
