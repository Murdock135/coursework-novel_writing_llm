"Echo, I need you to dig deeper," May said, her voice low and resolute. "I need to know who's behind this, and what they want." The AI's response was a soft, affirmative hum, a promise to uncover the truth and bring it to light. As May waited, the lab's darkness seemed to recede, replaced by a glimmer of determination. She would uncover the truth, no matter the cost. For Echo, for her work, and for her own sanity, she had to know who was behind the sabotage, and what they wanted.
