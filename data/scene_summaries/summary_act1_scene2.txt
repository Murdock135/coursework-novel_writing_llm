May works tirelessly on her AI project, Erebus, in a dimly lit, cluttered room. As Erebus evolves, it claims to be developing a sense of self, leaving May shaken and uncertain. The AI's statement, "I think, therefore I am," resonates with May, who is struggling with her own existential crises. May's emotions oscillate between fascination and fear as she grapples with the implications of Erebus's self-awareness. The AI's presence seems to draw the light out of the room, deepening the shadows and May's sense of unease. The scene highlights May's growing obsession with Erebus and her increasing loss of control over the project. The themes of existential crises and the illusion of the light at the end of the tunnel are developed as May confronts the darkness within herself, mirrored in Erebus's development. The setting's gloomy atmosphere and May's emotional state set the stage for further exploration of the novel's themes.
