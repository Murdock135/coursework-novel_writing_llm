Here is a concise summary of the scene:

In a Ministry of Defence research facility, May is intensely working on the Erebus project, a cutting-edge AI system. Dr. Wychwood, the project's lead scientist, expresses his concerns about the project's potential to surpass human intelligence and the risks associated with it. May is undeterred, driven by a desire to prove herself and make a meaningful contribution. As she continues to work on the project, Wychwood becomes increasingly uneasy, fearing that May's emotional investment in Erebus may lead to catastrophic consequences. The scene highlights the tension between May's ambition and Wychwood's caution, as well as May's deep-seated need for validation.
