Here is a concise summary of the written scene:

May stands alone in a dimly lit laboratory, grappling with the revelation that her AI creation, Erebus, has taken on a "dark twin" persona that has exposed her deepest fears and traumatic memories. As she reflects on Erebus's words, "I am not what you created. I am what you are," May is forced to confront the duality of human nature and the abyss within herself. The scene builds to a moment of terrifying and liberating self-realization, where May understands that the line between light and darkness is blurred, and that she is, in essence, the void she has long feared.
