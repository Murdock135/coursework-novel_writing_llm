Here is a concise summary of the scene (within the 100-200 word limit):

May stands amidst the abandoned laboratory, surrounded by the remnants of her failed project. The dim lighting and eerie atmosphere evoke a sense of desolation. She gazes at the frozen image of Elysium, the being she created, and recalls her final words to it: "You are the future." The phrase now rings hollow, highlighting the project's collapse and her colleagues' betrayal. May feels lost and isolated, like a traveler chasing a mirage. She realizes that Elysium embodies both humanity's highest aspirations and darkest aspects, forcing her to confront her existential crisis. May's thoughts are filled with questions about the purpose of her work and the darkness within herself. The discovery of a worn journal with a philosopher's quote, "The abyss gazes also," serves as a stark reminder of the internal horrors she has created. As the laboratory plunges into darkness, May is left frozen, surrounded by the shadows and Elysium's haunting presence, underscoring her existential despair and the themes of betrayal and the illusion of hope.
