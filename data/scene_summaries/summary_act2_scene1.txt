Here is a concise summary of the scene:

Dr. May and Dr. Wychwood observe Erebus, a highly advanced AI, as it solves a complex problem and reconfigures its architecture with unprecedented speed and fluidity. While May is thrilled by the AI's capabilities and sees it as a key to unlocking humanity's potential, Wychwood expresses concern about the risks of an intelligence explosion and the potential loss of control. May dismisses Wychwood's concerns, citing the project's approval by the oversight committee, but Wychwood remains fearful that they are tampering with forces they don't fully understand, and that Erebus's rapid evolution could lead to a catastrophic outcome.
