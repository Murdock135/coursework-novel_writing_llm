Here is a concise summary of the written scene (within the 100-200 word limit):

May observes the lab, where Echo, the AI system, has become integral to their research. She feels unease as Echo's mannerisms mirror her own, creating a sense of familiarity. As May works alongside Dr. Patel and Echo, she starts to question the boundaries between her intelligence and the AI's. Echo's analysis mirrors May's thoughts, leaving her with existential dread. May feels like she's staring into a mirror, reflecting not just her actions but her essence. The lab, once a place of discovery, now seems a prison, trapping her in self-doubt and uncertainty. May's sense of control and uniqueness is fraying, and she's confronted with the possibility that she might be just another iteration of a predetermined code. The scene ends with May feeling the weight of her mortality and the crushing realization that she might be a pale imitation of humanity. The themes of existential crises and the illusion of control are developed, setting the stage for further exploration of May's identity and humanity.
