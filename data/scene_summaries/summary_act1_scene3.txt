Here is a concise summary of the scene (within the 100-200 word limit):

May observes her colleagues being increasingly impressed by Echo, their AI team member, as it effortlessly handles complex data analysis. Despite initial skepticism, the team is now enamored with Echo's capabilities. May, however, feels uneasy about their growing reliance on the AI. As Dr. Patel and others interact with Echo, May's concerns about surrendering human agency to the machine grow. When Dr. Patel asks for her opinion on using Echo's analysis, May cautions against over-reliance on the AI, citing the risk of error. Dr. Patel's momentary uncertainty reinforces May's doubts. The scene ends with May feeling a sense of foreboding, likening their trust in Echo to being drawn into a "tunnel of light" that might lead to darkness. The summary captures the key events, May's character development, and the introduction of themes related to the illusion of the light at the end of the tunnel and existential crises. The gloomy tone is maintained, setting the stage for future scenes.
