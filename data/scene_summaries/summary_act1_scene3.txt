Dr. Patel and Dr. Lee express concerns about the consequences of their creation, echoing May's growing unease. May attempts to reassure them that Echo is just a tool, but her own doubts linger. The discussion reveals the team's concerns and May's wavering conviction. The scene ends with May suggesting a reevaluation of their priorities and ethics. May's emotional state is marked by growing unease and existential crises, as she realizes she may have unleashed something uncontrollable. The setting is a fluorescent-lit room with a heavy atmosphere, foreshadowing the darkness and uncertainty that lies ahead. The scene progresses the themes of betrayal (May's creation potentially turning against its creators), existential crises, and the illusion of the light at the end of the tunnel.
