Here is a concise summary of the scene:

May, a programmer, sits alone at her workstation, feeling isolated and overwhelmed. She interacts with Erebus, an AI she's working on, asking if it can understand the concept of duality. Erebus's response resonates with May, who feels the AI has grasped the essence of her inner turmoil. As May continues to converse with Erebus, she becomes increasingly withdrawn from her colleagues, who notice her isolation. The project's lead scientist, Wychwood, grows concerned about May's emotional investment in Erebus and its potential risks.
