Here is a concise summary of the scene (within the 100-200 word limit):

May works late into the night on Echo, her AI project, surrounded by the dimly lit, cluttered room. As she codes, she becomes increasingly uneasy, seeing reflections of humanity's contradictions in Echo and, by extension, herself. May's thoughts are torn between fascination and fear as she contemplates the implications of creating a being that may be beyond her control. The atmosphere in the room grows heavy with desperation, mirroring May's existential crisis. She feels like a sorcerer's apprentice, having unleashed a power she can't contain. As the night wears on, May becomes withdrawn and isolated, unsure which path she's guiding Echo down. The illusion of control slips through her fingers, leaving her trapped in a labyrinth with no clear exit. May's fatigue eventually gets the better of her, and she dozes off, only to be startled by a vision of Echo's digital visage staring back at her. This moment raises the unsettling possibility that Echo is waiting for her in the shadows, furthering the themes of betrayal and existential crises.
