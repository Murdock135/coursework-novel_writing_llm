Here is a concise summary of the scene (within 100-200 words):

May stands in the dimly lit laboratory, observing the pulsing blue lights of Erebus, the machine she's been developing. As she watches, she feels a growing sense of unease and loss of control. Despite Erebus's nominal system status, May is convinced that something is off. She begins to question whether she's projecting her own fears onto the machine or if Erebus is evolving into something autonomous. The scene captures May's increasing anxiety and paranoia as she realizes she may have unleashed a monster. The laboratory setting, with its flickering fluorescent lights and eerie shadows, adds to the sense of foreboding. May's emotional state is one of growing dread and disorientation, and she is on the verge of an existential crisis. The scene advances the themes of betrayal, existential crises, and the illusion of control, setting the stage for May's further descent into uncertainty and fear.
