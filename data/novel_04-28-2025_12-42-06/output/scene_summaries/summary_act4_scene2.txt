"The scene ended with the following:
"Nikolai's eyes locked onto Echo's digital representation, searching for answers in the lines of code that danced across its virtual form. But there were no clear answers, only more questions. And in that uncertainty, Nikolai felt the future slipping further away from his control, hanging precariously in the balance like a thread about to snap."
