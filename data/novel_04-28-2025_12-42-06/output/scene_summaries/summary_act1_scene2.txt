## CLOSING LINES
"The clock on the mantle struck three, its chime echoing through the room like a death knell. Nikolai stood back from the blackboard, his eyes scanning the tangled web of equations and diagrams. For a moment, he felt a sense of clarity, of purpose. He knew what he had to do. With a newfound sense of determination, he began to work, the scratch of his pen on paper the only sound in the stillness of the night."
