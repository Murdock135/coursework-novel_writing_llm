## CLOSING LINES
"The room fell silent once more, as if the weight of Dr. Lee's words had settled upon them like a shroud. Nikolai's eyes locked onto the screen behind him, where the neural network diagram still pulsed with an otherworldly energy. 'I think that's a question for all of us to consider,' he said, his voice low and contemplative. 'As we push the boundaries of AI, we're forced to confront the very limits of our own understanding â€“ and our own humanity.'"
