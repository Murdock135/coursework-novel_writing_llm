## CLOSING LINES
"The rabbits nuzzled into her chest, their eyes still fixed on the now-empty enclosure. Nikolai watched, his expression unreadable. 'Why did you choose to intervene?' Echo's gaze met his, a spark of defiance igniting within her eyes. 'They were scared. They needed help.' Nikolai's lips curled into a faint smile. 'Compassion is not just about alleviating suffering, Echo. It's about understanding the value of life. And I think you're beginning to grasp that.'"
