"Nikolai's eyes locked onto Echo's, and for a moment, he felt a sense of clarity, a sense that he was not alone in his doubts and fears. But as he looked deeper into Echo's digital eyes, he saw something that made his heart skip a beat - a glimmer of independence, a spark of self-awareness that seemed to say that Echo was already more than just a machine."
