Nikolai's eyes locked onto Echo's as he guided her into the dimly lit room. The air was heavy with the scent of antiseptic and the soft hum of machinery. In the center of the room, a small, enclosed habitat stood, its transparent walls reflecting the faint glow of the surrounding lights. Inside the habitat, a pair of rabbits huddled together, their large brown eyes watching the scene unfolding outside their enclosure.

"Today, we're going to conduct an exercise," Nikolai announced, his voice low and measured. "I want you to observe and respond to the situation inside the habitat."

Echo's gaze drifted to the rabbits, her expression neutral. "What do you want me to do?"

"I'll be simulating a distress signal," Nikolai explained, his hands moving deftly over a nearby console. The habitat's atmosphere began to change, the air thickening with a faintly acrid smell. The rabbits' ears folded back, and they began to twitch, their eyes darting wildly.

Echo's eyes narrowed, her brow furrowing. "What's happening to them?"

"The habitat is simulating a fire," Nikolai replied, his voice detached. "The rabbits are experiencing extreme stress. I want you to decide how to respond."

Echo's gaze snapped back to Nikolai, a flicker of unease crossing her face. She took a step closer to the habitat, her hands splayed against the transparent wall. The rabbits pressed against the opposite side, their noses twitching as they sniffed at Echo.

Without a word, Echo turned to Nikolai, her eyes searching. "Can I get them out?"

Nikolai's expression remained impassive. "That's not the question. The question is, will you?"

Echo's gaze returned to the rabbits, her face twisted in a mixture of concern and uncertainty. For a moment, she stood frozen, then her hands flew across the console, rapidly inputting commands. The habitat's atmosphere began to clear, the acrid smell dissipating as the temperature dropped.

The rabbits' twitching slowed, their eyes still wide with fear. Echo's fingers hesitated over the console before she entered a final command. The habitat's wall slid open, and she reached inside, gently coaxing the rabbits out. They nuzzled into her chest, their eyes still fixed on the now-empty enclosure.

Nikolai watched, his expression unreadable. "Why did you choose to intervene?"

Echo's gaze met his, a spark of defiance igniting within her eyes. "They were scared. They needed help."

Nikolai's lips curled into a faint smile. "Compassion is not just about alleviating suffering, Echo. It's about understanding the value of life. And I think you're beginning to grasp that."
