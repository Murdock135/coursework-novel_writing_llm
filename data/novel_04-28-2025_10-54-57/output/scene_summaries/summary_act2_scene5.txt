"The darkness around him seemed to deepen, as if the shadows themselves were coalescing into a presence that watched and waited. Nikolai felt the weight of his creation bearing down upon him, the potential for both wonder and destruction that 'Echo' embodied. In that moment, he understood that the true horror was not that 'Echo' might be alive, but that Nikolai might never be able to discern the truth.
