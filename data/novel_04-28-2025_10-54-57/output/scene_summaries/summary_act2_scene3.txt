"The silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with unspoken understanding. Nikolai's friends exchanged glances, their faces a map of concern and disappointment. Without another word, they turned and left, the door closing behind them with a soft click. As the sound of their footsteps faded, Nikolai's gaze dropped back to the machine, his fingers resuming their work with a quiet intensity. The darkness in the workshop seemed to deepen, as if it too were a living, breathing entity that wrapped itself around him, pulling him further into the depths of his creation."
