Nikolai's eyes felt gritty from lack of sleep as he hunched over his workbench, the faint scent of machine oil and solder filling the air. The mechanical computer, once a skeletal framework of gears and levers, now began to take on a life of its own, its parts whirring and clicking in a staccato rhythm. He barely registered the knock at the door, too engrossed in the delicate task of aligning a series of intricate cams.

The knock came again, louder this time, followed by the sound of the door creaking open. "Nikolai, we've been trying to reach you for days," Elsa said, her voice tinged with concern as she stepped into the workshop. "You've been avoiding us, haven't you?"

Nikolai looked up, his gaze unfocused, as if he'd been disturbed from a reverie. Elsa was accompanied by Franz and Konrad, their faces etched with worry. For a moment, he seemed not to recognize them, his eyes drifting back to the machine as if drawn by an unseen force.

"We were starting to get worried," Franz added, his tone gentle but insistent. "You've been so caught up in this project... You're not taking care of yourself, Nikolai."

Nikolai's expression shifted, a mixture of defensiveness and detachment settling on his features. "I'm fine," he said curtly, wiping his hands on a rag. "I've just been... focused."

Konrad stepped forward, his eyes scanning the cluttered workshop. "Focused? Nikolai, you've been locked away in here for weeks. You're starting to scare us."

The air was thick with tension as Nikolai's friends waited for him to respond. For a moment, it seemed as though he might open up to them, let them in on the secrets that drove him. But instead, he turned back to his workbench, his hands resuming their task with a quiet determination.

"I'm on the verge of something here," he said, his voice low and even. "Something that could change everything. I just need a little more time."

Elsa's expression softened, a blend of empathy and concern etched on her face. "Nikolai, we're not trying to stop you. We just want to make sure you're okay. You're not alone in this."

Nikolai's hands stilled, his fingers hovering above the machine. For an instant, a glimmer of the man he once was seemed to surface, a fleeting sense of connection to those around him. But it was quickly extinguished, replaced by an unyielding resolve.

"I'm fine," he repeated, his voice firm but distant. "I just need to see this through."

The silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with unspoken understanding. Nikolai's friends exchanged glances, their faces a map of concern and disappointment. Without another word, they turned and left, the door closing behind them with a soft click.

As the sound of their footsteps faded, Nikolai's gaze dropped back to the machine, his fingers resuming their work with a quiet intensity. The darkness in the workshop seemed to deepen, as if it too were a living, breathing entity that wrapped itself around him, pulling him further into the depths of his creation.
